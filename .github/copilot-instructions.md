Use Go with as few third party dependencies as possible. We can maintain our own code :)

Never deviate from the task in hand. Create notes if you see something else that needs to be fixed, don't try to do too much at once.

Always make code changes on a new branch. When done, commit with a detailed message and issue a PR using GitHub MCP.

Always refer to TODO.md for the current tasks to be done. If something is not listed there, do not do it.

When you complete a task, mark it as done in TODO.md. When it is complete, we will issue a PR in GitHub.

Ensure all new code is well tested. Add unit tests and integration tests as needed.

Always create new features in a feature branch prefixed with "feature/". For example, "feature/add-logging".
